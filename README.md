# Welcome to Reizen
# The pretentious flight and packing list creator!

To get started, please login using a (valid) email and (secret) password!

After you have logged in, you now have the option to create your own flight plan! This includes where you're going, where you're leaving from, when you plan on leaving, and when you plan on returning!

When you create a flight, it'll save to your profile and from there you can create a packing list for that trip!
This way when the trip comes up, you'll know exactly what you need for it!

You can add, edit, or delete any item off the list! Just hit the "Add/Edit" button to add an item or to update an existing item, or the delete button if you don't want that item at all!

You can also add, edit, or delete any flights and trips you've made! Got caught in a pandemic? No problem, just delete the trip and now you don't need that PTSD anymore!

You can also click the "Add/Edit" button to change to the edit form where you can update any trips you've made!

Once you're done with all this, just click the logout button and you're good to go, with all your trips kept secret and safe from trip spies!


Hope you enjoyed Reizen!
